			<p>In this blog, I want to explain the concept of tweeter mining, getting feature attributes desired using tweepy
				API and
				doing exploratory analysis on the dataset obtained.
			<p>
			<p> We will also see some of the ways to create visualizations.
			<p>
			<p>This project was funded by <a class="10Acad" href="https://www.10academy.org/">10 Academy</a> as part of my
				training.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Social media campaigns
				are mostly driven by influencial individuals in the network and therefore identifying them becomes such a big
				win.
				This project was undertaken to find out the most influential twitter users, which hashtags are
				used, and what parameters are used to identify influential rate of a twitter user. 
				Parameters used for the task were: 
				<ul>
					<li>Popularity score: measured by the number of retweets and likes users get</li>
					<li>Reach score: measured by the size of audience a single user has (comprise of followers and the people they follow)</li>
					<li>Relevance score: measured by the number of mentions a single user has.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<h3>Data Extraction</h3>
			<p>
				To investigate the goal mentioned above, I obtained data by scraping
				<a href="https://africafreak.com/100-most-influential-twitter-users-in-africa">Africa Influential Tweeter
					Users</a> and
				<a
					href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/african-leaders-respond-to-coronavirus-ontwitter/#east-africa">Africa
					leaders response to Corona virus</a> websites.
					I extracted twitter handles from the data obtained from these websites which formed two lists for twitter influential users and government officials respectively.
				<h3>Data Processing</h3>
				<p>
					Since the data was not all clean, I started by doing data wrangling to ensure I had the data in
				good shape. This included dropping rows with missing values since other methods for handling
				missing values were not fit for the rows. I also did feature engineering so as to obtain the result I
				needed.
				</p>
				<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
				I did visualization on the clean to data to help get insight of the trend in the data. 
				The main focus was on the three ranking scores of measuring
				influence; popular score, Relevance score and Reach score.
				
				<h4>Popularity score for Africa goverment officials and Africa twitter influencers</h4>

				<h4>Reach score for Africa goverment officials and Africa twitter influencers</h4>
				<img src="./reach_score_gov.png" alt="reach score government" width="300" height="300">
				<img src="./reach_score_inf.png" alt="reach score influencers" width="300" height="300">

				<h4>Relevance score for Africa goverment officials and Africa twitter influencers</h4>
				<img src="./relevance_score_gov.png" alt="relevance score government" width="300" height="300">
				<img src="./relevance_score_inf.png" alt="relevance score influencers" width="300" height="300">
			</p>

			<h3>Conclusion and Recommendation</h3>
			<p>
				Retweet influence, mentions influence and indegree influence have big a role to play in determining the
			level of influence a user has on the society and its environment. And this is a strength that can be
			tapped into and utilized by businesses to push products and services through campaigns by partnering
			with the most influential users through marketing and advertising. This is dependent on the category of
			the content of the user.
			I would recommend other factors that determine a userâ€™s influence to be factored in determining if one
			is more influential other than the use of the three ranks of measuring influence. For instance, the
			interpersonal relationship of a user with the virtual community can be considered.
