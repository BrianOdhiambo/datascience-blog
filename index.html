				<p>In this blog, I want to explain the concept of tweeter mining, getting feature attributes desired and 
        doing exploratory analysis on the dataset obtained.<p>
        <p> We will also see some of the ways to create visualizations.<p>
        <p>This project was funded by 10 Academy as part of my training</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This project was undertaken to find out the most influential twitter users, which hashtags are
          used, and what parameters are used to identify influential rate of a twitter user.
          Parameters used for the task were: popularity score, reach score and relevance score. These
          parameters were to be checked for the twitter users obtained in the dataset.
          Two dataframes were used in the project, one for most influential twitter users and the other for
          Africa government officials.
        </p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          To investigate the goal mentioned above, I obtained data by scraping
          <a href="https://africafreak.com/100-most-influential-twitter-users-in-africa">Africa Influential Tweeter Users</a> and
          <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/african-leaders-respond-to-coronavirus-ontwitter/#east-africa">Africa leaders response to Corona virus</a> websites after which I mined twitter using the twitter handles obtained.
          Since the data was not all clean, I started by doing data wrangling to ensure I had the data in
          good shape. This included dropping rows with missing values since other methods for handling
          missing values were not fit for the rows. I also did feature engineering so as to obtain the result I
          needed.
          I did visualization on the clean to data to help get insight of the trend in the data. This helped
          draw some conclusions on the data.
          I then combined the two dataframes to find the common hashtag used by both set of users in the
          two dataframes. I also did some visualizations on the combined dataframe which helped in
          drawing more insight.
